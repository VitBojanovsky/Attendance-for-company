This is a school project assigned to me by my teacher
This simple web app should allow employees to log in their attendance and view it in a table
There will be a backend with a db added later but as of now it is only frontend with the only important files are index.html styles.css and script.js other files will be important later
With every commit my RPI clones the repo and hosts it
